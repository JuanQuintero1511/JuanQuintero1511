## Hello, my name is Juan Manuel Rodr√≠guez Quintero

### And I'm a junior-level full-stack developer. I am passionate about programming and the digital world. My enthusiasm for creating innovative solutions and tackling technological challenges drives me to constantly expand my skills and knowledge. With a balanced focus on front-end and back-end development, I can build high-performance web applications and appealing user interfaces. With a curious and results-oriented mindset, I am always seeking new ways to enhance user experience and code efficiency. My goal is to grow professionally in a collaborative environment where I can contribute my technical skills and positive attitude to drive team success and contribute to the company's growth. I am excited to showcase what I can do!

My Projects:
Pokemon Api: I have developed a solo project called Pok√©mon API with the aim of enhancing my programming experience and skills. It involves creating a server that utilizes a database and the Pok√©mon API to provide users with an interface where they can explore information about existing Pok√©mon and even create their own custom Pok√©mon.
